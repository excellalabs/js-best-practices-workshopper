# Verify Vending Machine
Now that we've decomposed our initial JavaScript file into three separate, self-contained classes, we should finally test the remaining methods that act as the entry points into these classes' functionality. In practice, you should always delegate specific functionality to its own service and have a controller like ```vendingMachine.js``` orchestrate all the work that these services do. If all has gone well, the only thing you should have to do in this exercise is replace any ```this``` references with references to the classes that call the methods.
