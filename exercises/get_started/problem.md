# Getting Started

The goal of this workshopper is to help you learn how to create a resilient codebase using best practices. 
The workshopper will guide you through some excercises which will have you make incremental improvements to 
a bad codebase. Through the excercises, you will learn best practices to help keep your code maintainable, as well 
as some bad practices to avoid.

You will be making changes to a vending machine app. You will be given a file called `vendingMachine.js` as well as a few
other empty js files. The next few excercises will have you break down the vending machine into a program that still functions
the same but is easier to maintain, test, and update. 

When you exit this instructions screen, the files necessary for the excercises will be downloaded for you.
