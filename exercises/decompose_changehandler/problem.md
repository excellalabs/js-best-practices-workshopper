# Separation of Concerns Part 2
This is the second exercise to display the concept of Separation of Concerns.

We have already separated out all of the balance related methods, now we will look at the change related ones. Take the method that relates to handling change and move it into `changeHandler.js`.

Just like last time, make sure that the new `changeHandler` is now calling the function, run the tests, and you will have successfully integrated a `changeHandler` into your Vending Machine.
