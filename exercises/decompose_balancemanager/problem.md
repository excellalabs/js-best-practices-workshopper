# Separation of Concerns Part 1
This exercise will display the concept of Separation of Concerns. Our file, `vendingMachine.js`, is too large and contains too many functions. In order to make our code simpler and more maintainable, we will be grouping functions together into their own files. 

To pass this exercise, take the 5 methods and any variables that relate to balance management and move them to `balanceManager.js`. Then, back in vendingMachine.js, change the method of calling those functions from `this` to our new `balanceManager`. 

That's it! Move those four methods, make sure they are being called by the `balanceManager`, run the tests, and we will have a functioning balanceManager as part of our Vending Machine.
