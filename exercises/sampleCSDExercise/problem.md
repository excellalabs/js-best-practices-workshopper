## Welcome to the Vending Machine of Death where everything is fake and the prices don't matter. 

# Input
The input to the program is a list of arguments, alternating between the item name and cost. The length of the argument list will be even, but it is unlimited (hint: process.argv is an array).

# Output
Your task is to write a program that outputs (hint: console.log) a list of each item in the following format: "{name}: ${cost}", followed by a line with "Total: ${total_cost}". 

Good luck!
